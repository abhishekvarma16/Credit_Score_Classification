# Credit Score Classification Using Pyspark
Credit score classification is a critical task in the financial industry, enabling institutions to assess the risk profile of individuals and make informed lending decisions. This project focuses on predicting a person's credit score category (e.g., good, poor and standard credit) based on a variety of financial features. Accurate credit score predictions help streamline credit approval processes, minimize defaults, and improve risk management.

**Poor Credit**: Indicates a high risk of default.

**Standard Credit**: Shows moderate creditworthiness.

**Good Credit**: Reflecting low risk and strong creditworthiness.

To achieve this, I have utilized PySpark, a robust framework for large-scale data processing and machine learning. PySpark's distributed computing capabilities make it well-suited for handling large datasets efficiently. We implement and evaluate classification models, including Logistic Regression and Random Forest, to identify the most effective approach for predicting credit scores.
